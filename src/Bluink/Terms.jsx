          Our Course Material is only licensed to you and/or a Minor User and is
          not sold to you and/or a Minor User. The license granted to you does
          not give you and/or the Minor User any right to transfer or resell the

          information with a purchaser or downloading the Course Material and
          sharing it on third-party sources).

          may decide at any time to no longer provide Support System in
          association with a Course. To be clear, the lifetime access is only to
          the Course content and not to add-on features and Services associated
          with a Course.
